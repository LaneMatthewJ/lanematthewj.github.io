`metnet-direct-auxiliary` is a scientific software package developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) for investigating the causal relationships between fungal metabolomic outputs and the chemical treatments that trigger them.

Key Features:
- Two analysis modes:
  1. **Direct route** for known and putative metabolites induced by treatments.
  2. **Discovery route** for identifying unknown analytes from treatment-induced responses.
- Outputs include:
  * Network representations of metabolite-treatment associations.
  * Network-based metrics to rank both metabolomic features and treatments by importance.
- Closed-source, scientific software published via OSTI.GOV.
