Course material for CS2261, covering Java fundamentals, objects, interfaces, abstract classes, and object-oriented programming principles.

## Course Overview
This course introduces students to the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) using the Java programming language. Students gain practical experience in writing and designing reusable, modular, and maintainable code through hands-on labs and projects.

## Topics Covered
- Java syntax and development environment setup
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Interfaces and abstract classes
- Exception handling
- Basic file I/O and Java collections
- Unit testing and code debugging

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Design class hierarchies to model real-world systems
- Implement polymorphic behavior using interfaces and abstract base classes
- Apply principles of encapsulation and modularity to manage complexity
- Debug and test Java applications effectively

## Audience
Second-year undergraduate students majoring in computer science or software engineering.

## Tools Used
- Java SE Development Kit (JDK)
- IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse IDE
- JUnit for unit testing
