### Summary:
- **Inventors:** Murali G. Meena, Armin G. Geiger, Daniel A. Jacobson, Matthew J. Lane  
- **Patent Publication No.:** US 2024/0079083 A1  
- **Publication Date:** March 7, 2024  
- **Filing Date:** September 8, 2023  
- **Applicant:** UT-Battelle, LLC, Oak Ridge, TN (United States)  
- **OSTI Accession:** 2024-0079083-A1  
- **Primary Institution:** Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)  
- **Sponsoring Agency:** U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Contract No. AC05-00OR22725  

### Capabilities:
- **Two analysis routes:**
  1. **Direct route** for known secondary metabolites.
  2. **Auxiliary route** for untargeted exploration of unknown analytes.
- **Workflow Components:**
  * LC-MS data preprocessing
  * Bipartite network construction linking treatments and metabolites
  * Network centrality calculations (PageRank, degree, etc.)
  * Post-analysis modules for ranking, prioritization, and validation

### Visual Highlight:
The *network analysis diagram on page 1* shows the integration of metabolomic inputs, graph-based modeling, and post-processing to guide biological interpretation.

This approach enables **data-driven discovery of bioactive metabolites** and potential **drug-discovery targets**, with applications in fungal biology, biotechnology, and chemical screening workflows.
