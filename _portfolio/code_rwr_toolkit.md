`RWRtoolkit` is an open-source scientific software package developed to perform Random Walk with Restart (RWR) analyses on multiplex networks across any species. It provides a set of command-line utilities and R tools designed for biological network modeling at scale.

### Features:
- Supports analysis of multiplex networks with species-agnostic architecture.
- Integrates well with omics datasets for downstream biological interpretation.
- Built with R and designed for reproducible, high-throughput inference.
