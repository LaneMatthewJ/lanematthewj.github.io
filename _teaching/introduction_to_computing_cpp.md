An introductory computer science course (CS1250) for students with no prior programming background. This course builds a foundation in computational thinking and procedural programming using C++.

## Course Overview
This course introduces students to the core concepts of computing through the lens of C++ programming. Emphasis is placed on understanding how to model simple problems and implement solutions using standard programming constructs.

The course intentionally **does not** cover object-oriented programming. Instead, the focus remains on mastering foundational concepts such as variables, memory, control flow, and modular program structure.

## Topics Covered
- **Fundamentals**
  - What is a program?
  - Binary, compilation, and the role of a compiler
  - Input/output and the terminal
- **Data Types & Variables**
  - Integers, floats, characters, booleans
  - Type casting, literals, and constants
- **Control Flow**
  - `if`, `else`, `switch`
  - Comparison and logical operators
- **Loops**
  - `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops
  - Loop control with `break` and `continue`
- **Functions**
  - Defining and calling functions
  - Parameter passing: pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference
  - Return types and scoping rules
- **Arrays**
  - Declaring and accessing arrays
  - Iterating over arrays
  - Multidimensional arrays (2D)
- **Structs**
  - Grouping data into composite types
  - Passing structs to functions
- **Code Style and Debugging**
  - Naming conventions, indentation, and code clarity
  - Compiler errors vs. runtime errors
  - Basic debugging and trace-based reasoning

## Learning Objectives
Students who complete this course will be able to:
- Translate real-world problems into precise algorithms
- Write, debug, and test C++ programs using structured procedural design
- Understand how memory and variables interact
- Use functions and arrays to build modular and reusable code
- Explain parameter passing semantics and scope management

## Tools Used
- GNU g++ Compiler
- VS Code / CLion IDE
- Linux terminal & Makefiles (optional intro)

## Audience
First-year students in computer science, engineering, or scientific fields seeking a rigorous introduction to structured programming.
