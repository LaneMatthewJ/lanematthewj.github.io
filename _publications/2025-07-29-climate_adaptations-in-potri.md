excerpt: 'This study identifies genetic and physiological traits underpinning drought adaptation in Populus trichocarpa, a key bioenergy crop. By examining over 1300 genotypes in a large-scale field experiment, the authors reveal that stomatal and leaf traits—especially a major locus on chromosome 10—are tightly linked to climatic origin and are likely to evolve under future arid conditions. Their findings provide crucial targets for breeding resilient trees to meet biofuel demands on marginal lands in a changing climate.'
